Git commands: 
My repo: https://github.com/Foiz-Ashik/assignmentOne

I am working on a windows so I downloaded git from https://git-scm.com. 

After installation I am able to run git from command prompt anywhere on the computer and I can also right click on any directory and open git bash there.

Below is how I ran each command and uploaded to my repository. 

Git clone:

After running git push it asks for my github credentials before pushing it to the repository.
. 
Now it has been added to my repository.

I will now make a change and commit the changes into my repository. 

After the changes I now see the updated file under my repo.
